Wheels-on-the-bus
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
round and round,
round and round.
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
all through the town.
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish,
swish, swish, swish,
swish, swish, swish.
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish,
all through the town.
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep
beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep.
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep,
all through the town.
The doors on the bus go open and shut,
open and shut,
open and shut,
The doors on the bus go open and shut,
all through the town.

Ba-ba-black-sheep
Bah, Bah a black Sheep,
Have you any Wool?
Yes merry have I,
Three Bags full,
One for my master,
One for my Dame,
One for the little Boy
That lives down the lane.

Johny Johny, Yes Papa
Eating sugar? No, Papa!
Telling lies? No, Papa!
Open your mouth, Ha! Ha! Ha!
