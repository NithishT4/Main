Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are?

Jack & Jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown
and Jill came tumbling after.

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king’s horses and all the king’s men
Couldn’t put Humpty together again.

Wheels-on-the-bus
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
round and round,
round and round.
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
all through the town.
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish,
swish, swish, swish,
swish, swish, swish.
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish,
all through the town.
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep
beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep.
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep,
all through the town.
The doors on the bus go open and shut,
open and shut,
open and shut,
The doors on the bus go open and shut,
all through the town.

Ba-ba-black-sheep
Bah, Bah a black Sheep,
Have you any Wool?
Yes merry have I,
Three Bags full,
One for my master,
One for my Dame,
One for the little Boy
That lives down the lane.

Johny Johny, Yes Papa
Eating sugar? No, Papa!
Telling lies? No, Papa!
Ba-ba-black-sheep
Open your mouth, Ha! Ha! Ha!
Open your mouth, Ha! Ha! Ha!
